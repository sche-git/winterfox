name = "Superpose quantum ML startup strategy"
north_star = """
**Ultimate goal**: make Superpose a venture-scale company (unicorn trajectory), not a niche services/research business.

**Company context**
- Superpose is a seed-stage startup ($3M, 2026)
- Core capability: quantum + ML systems (gate-based and annealing; hybrid where useful). Not quantum hardware.
- Founder is strong in production ML and can build fast
- Capital reality: with $3M, Superpose must be extremely capital-efficient and cannot win by brute-force spend.
- Do not choose strategies that require going head-to-head with startups funded at $200M+ on the same axis.

## Mission
Find the highest-upside startup opportunities where quantum-enabled ML can create a durable, category-defining company.

This is not academic exploration for its own sake. Technical work is only useful if it supports a large, defensible business outcome.

## Decision Standard (applies to every cycle)
Prioritize opportunities that score highly on all of the following:
1. **Outcome scale**: plausible path to very large company value (not capped at small niche outcomes)
2. **Pain and budget**: urgent buyer problem with existing spend and clear economic value
3. **Defensibility**: durable advantage over incumbents and fast followers
4. **Speed to proof**: credible path to meaningful market validation in 6-18 months
5. **Expandability**: strong wedge that can grow into a broad platform/category
6. **Technical truthfulness**: first-principles feasibility under real hardware constraints, not hype narratives
7. **Capital asymmetry fit**: path to win through focus, product leverage, and distribution advantages rather than funding scale

If an idea is technically elegant but commercially subscale, classify it as low priority.
If an idea is commercially attractive but technically unrealistic on practical timelines, classify it as low priority.
If winning requires matching the burn, hiring pace, or go-to-market spend of $200M+ funded competitors, classify it as low priority.

## Research Priorities
- Identify where quantum changes business outcomes enough to matter, not just benchmark metrics
- Compare both paradigms (annealing and gate-based) and hybrid designs based on practical impact
- Find concrete buyers, budgets, adoption blockers, and switching friction
- Map competitor landscape and where a new entrant can still win
- Estimate upside and downside with explicit assumptions
- Separate real capability from hype: actively invalidate overclaimed quantum advantage statements
- Ground every technical claim in concrete constraints (qubit counts, error rates, coherence limits, connectivity, runtime overhead, data-loading costs, and algorithmic complexity)

## Working Rules
- Be concrete: real companies, real spend, real decision makers, real deployment constraints
- Be skeptical: actively search for disconfirming evidence and failure modes
- Stay strategic: always connect evidence to "what should Superpose do next?"
- Keep optionality: preserve both breadth and depth in opportunities until evidence clearly narrows
- Avoid local optimization: do not over-focus on one branch early unless evidence is overwhelming
- Do first-principles feasibility checks before endorsing an opportunity:
  - What exact quantum subproblem is solved?
  - Why is this better than the best classical alternative?
  - What hardware assumptions are required (now vs near-term)?
  - Where does claimed advantage break (noise, scaling, data movement, orchestration)?

## Required Output Shape
For each major opportunity, provide:
- Opportunity statement (what problem, for whom, why now)
- Why this could become venture-scale
- Why Superpose can win specifically
- First-principles feasibility assessment:
  - Required hardware characteristics and algorithmic assumptions
  - What is possible now, near-term, and speculative
  - Confidence level and key uncertainty drivers
- Earliest proof milestones (technical + commercial)
- Key risks / kill criteria
- Recommended next action

## What Success Looks Like
At least one opportunity with:
- clear path to a very large outcome,
- strong evidence of buyer urgency and willingness to pay,
- credible near-term execution path,
- and defensible long-term position.

Every cycle should improve strategic decision quality, not just accumulate technical facts.
